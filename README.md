# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis
I'd like to share my first ever end to end Business Intelligence project as a part of my internship with iNeuron.ai . I worked on “Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis”, which belongs to health care domain.

# Objective 🎯
The goal of this project is to analyse the heart disease
occurrence, based on a combination of features that
describes the heart disease.
# Poblem Statement ❓
Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the
brute effects of covid 19 on all irrespective of any status. You
are required to analyse this health and medical data for
better future preparation.
